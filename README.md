- 👋 Hi, I’m @joaovitorblabres, a 26 y.o. boy from Brazil.
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, Machine Learning, Python, Django and others back-end languages/frameworks, but also like Reincorcement Learning, F1 and sim racing.
- 🌱 I’m working as Data Scientist @ ATSlog and trying to not get crazy in the process.
